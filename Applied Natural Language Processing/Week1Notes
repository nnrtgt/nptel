How a toddler learns language from parents - Amazing


Why NLP is hard?
Multiple ways of representation of the same scenario - different sentences, formation
Includes common sense and contextual representation, we dont have to tell about the context everytime
Complex representation information (Vocabulary)
Mixing of visual cues, uses hands, facial expressions, stress on some words
Ambiguous in nature, 
Idioms, metaphors, sarcasm, double negatives, etc. makes it difficult for automatic processing - machine can't understand these
Human language interpretation depends on real world, common sense and contextual knowledge


Meta knowledge we have acquired over period of time should be fed to machine if we have to make it understand
