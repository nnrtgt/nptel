Started with the Example of Handwritten Recognition
Introduced to CoLab

What is the difference between Traditional Programming and Machine Learning
Training vs Inference/Prediction in Machine Learning


Data (Important for Machine Learning) - Features & Labels
Exampls - Housing Price, Recognizing the hand written digit

Discrete or Continuous 
Label  Present - Supervised Learning Algorithim
Label is Absent - Unsupervised Learning Algorithm

Supervised Learning can be divided into 
Classification if the label is discrete
Regression if the label is continous
Features:
Numerical (no. of bed rooms, area of the house)
Categorical (Colors, Cities)

Categorical can be convereted into Numerical 

Introduced One Hot Coding
Hashing and Embedding

Steps in Machine Learning

Data Preprocessing
Address the data quality issues
Inconsistencies 
Remove Outliers
