Given below are the ages of students from Kendriya Vidyalaya. We are building a machine learning model that uses the age of the student as a feature. However, we notice that our data has certain erroneous values in it. Which of the following normalization techniques would you use to normalize data with such erroneous values?

			[11, 15, 13, 14, 120, 16, 13, 14, 11, 12, 11, 13, 14, 13, 11]

Suppose you are given with the following training data for linear regression (h(x)=wx+b)
:
	    x=[3,2,1,0,]
	    y=[4,3,0,1,]
	      You are using loss function J(w,b)=12n∑i=0n[h(xi)−yi]2
	     What is the value of J(1,0)
?

In logistic regression (binary classification), we set the loss function for σ(x)
as cross-entropy loss, suppose we change it to squared-error loss
	    (as in linear regression). Will the gradient descent algorithm perform same as that in the cross-entropy case?
Yes
No
