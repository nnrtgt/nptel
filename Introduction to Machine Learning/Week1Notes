Machine Learning Definition 

Learn from experience w.r.t some class of tasks 

Measure the performance 

Performance improves with experience 

No. Of marks you obtain
No. Of patients saved
No. Of patients didnâ€™t get adverse effects




Class of tasks 
Performance measure
Experience



1997 - Tom Mitchell


It is known as 
Inductive Learning


Comfort of foot wearing a new shoe


Paradigms 

Supervised Learning

Learn the mapping, function - input to output 

Categorical output - Classification - YES or NO (Discrete Value)
Continuous Value - Regression Problem 


UnSupervised Learning 
Discover Patterns in the data
Clustering - Task - Cohesive Groups - categories
Association in data - Frequent cooccurrence  


Reinforcement Learning 
Control the behavior of the system 



Tasks - Performance Measures
Classification - Classification Error - Confusion Matrix
Regression - Error
Clustering. - Scatter, Spread, What fraction, Purity
Association Mining - Support and Confidence 

Reinforcement Learning - Cost/reward


Challenges 

How good is the model?
How do I chose the model?
Do I enough data?
Is the data of sufficient quality?
Errors in Data
Noise in images, 
Missing values 


How confident can I be of the results
Am I describing the data correctly?
Domain Dependent, Experience with data


Inductive Bias 

Training set

Training Algorithm

Validation/Test Set used for evaluation of the model - 

Encoding the data - Normalizing theInput and Output 

Error - 


Applications 
Fraud Detection - Transactions Data - Flag each transaction 
Sentiment Analysis - Movie Review - Positive/Negative
Employee engagement  - Attrition
Customer churn prediction

Medical Diagnosis 
Risk Analysis - Insurance 


Nearest neighbors
ANN
Support Systems 
Decision 


Different times of the day
Temperature

Trying to fit the noise based on the training data

Avoid Overfitting 
Under-fitting 

Linear Regression 

Take the errors
