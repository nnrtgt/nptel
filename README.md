There are several NPTEL Courses, I enrolled into Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Domain Specialization recently.  Tracking the Assignments and code samples under this repo.  Creating separate folders for each of the course.  So far there are two programming languages being used: Python and R.  These NPTEL courses are being taught by various professors of different IIT and IIM, premier institutes of India.  Do you also Want to enroll? Visit swayam.gov.in
